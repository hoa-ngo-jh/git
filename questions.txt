We have 2 big branch call master (to hold test features for test site) & production.

- When we are creating new feature, what branch should we based on and why?
  Due to the production branch contains the fully developed stable code, we should code on this branch.

- If we have a feature branch that haven't been merged to production and that branch have bug, what course of action are you going to do with Git to before resolving the bug?
 We need to switch to that 'feature branch' first, then resolve the bug.
 git checkout <feature branch>

- If someone accidentally merge a feature (feature/delete-user) onto production and have a list of commitId ended with (0492978, fc9348c, k101100), then another commit (a1fsas8) is added on top of the production branch. How do we remove that merged feature?
 git log: searching for merged commitId.
 git revert <commitId> -m 1
